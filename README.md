# Landing Page

This is a landing page created using only HTML and CSS to practice my CSS skills especially flexbox, I've customized the site after getting a picture of the layout from T.O.P

## Learning outcomes

- Demonstrate flexbox skills to provide layut for the page
- Picked up new CSS declarations by googling them and making use of them
- Used chrome dev tools to help debug my site in situations where things weren't working as expected.
